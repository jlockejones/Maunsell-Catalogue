# Maunsell-Catalogue
An enriched transcription of the first national English bibliography, printed by Andrew Maunsell and annotated by William Henry Miller.

The original document is currently held at the Huntington Library, CA. It has been digitised by Early English Books Online, and can be found here: https://www.proquest.com/docview/2248528319
This transcription was made possible by Transkribus: https://transkribus.eu

The finished transcription is encoded in XML. It separates text by page, and then by entry or cross-reference. 
Printed entries are, where possible, linked to an ESTC number. Manuscript entries will be similarly linked in the near future. 
Some pages are tagged by a loose category, but this is a work in progress.
Cross-references have their target page standardised in an attribution.
