      of the mightie God of Jacob.
      W
      Hat great account (most gracious
      Soueraigne) hath beene made of
      godly bookes, may euidently ap-
      peare by the value set uppon the
      bookes of curious Artes, brought
      to the Apoftles feete to be burnt:
      For if those bookes were valued
      to two thousand markes, Of what
      estimation shall wee account the
      bookes, whose author is God himselfe, who by his holy spi-
      rite hath inspired the Prophets, the Euangelists, the Apo-
      stles, and his true Ministers, to write and fet forth the same
      for the instruction of his owne people and Church? All
      the goods upon the earth cannot value them. The booke
      of God hath bene alwayes of his children more accounted
      of, than their liues, or anie thing elfe in this worlde what-
      soeuer.
      Which booke of God, by your facred Maielty delive-
      red to your louing and faithfull subiects: How excellencly
      it is translated: VVhat notable Comentaries &amp; Sermons
      are made theron, or anie part therof: VVhat heauenly &amp;
      christian instructions, in all the pointes of chriftian religi-
      on, concerning the knowledge of GOD and his worde :
      What zelous admonitions to yong &amp; old, for the amen-
      dement of our wicked liues: and how plentifully handled
      in our own tongue, these my poor labours may testify

      tonque, the wonderful works of God. So now by ordina-
      rie meanes for the furtheraunce of the same, hath hee gi-
      uen not onely his holy spirit to your facred Maiestie, and
      godly subiects, but also the gift of Tongues. Whereby it
      is come to passe (through the blessing of God, and your
      moft godly and peaceable gouernment) that whatsoeuer
      excellent knowledge of God, or godlynesse is in anie lan-
      guage, we have it in some measure in our owne
      Seeing then that thefe diuine bookes are so mightily
      increased fince your Ma. blessed raigne, I have thought it
      worth my poore labour, to collect a Catalogue of them,
      whereby your Maiefties moft faithfull and louing sub-
      jects may be put in remembrance of the workes of so ex-
      cellent Authors, namely, such bookes as have been either
      written or tranflated by godly &amp; learned Kings, Queenes,
      Martyrs, and moft noble Confessors of the truth of the
      word of God.
      I beseech your Royall Maiestie to pardon my boldnes
      in offring these rude &amp; vnperfect collectios to your High-
      nes moft learned view, which I have not done in respect of
      my owne trauell heerein, but in most humble and duetifull
      regard, for that as wel my selfe as all other your Ma. louing
      subiects may freely vse all those good bookes within this
      Cataloque Specifyed, and many more, onely by your Ma-

      Lord God to multiply your blessed yeres with honorable
      peace, to the glory of his name, &amp; comfort of al your faith-

      <print>TO THE REVEREND
      Diuines, and Louers of Diuine
      Bookes, true knowledge of God, and a
      good Conscience.
      I
      Doe verily thinke (most Reuerend fathers &amp; bre-
      thren in Christ) that if the widow that Christ be-
      held, which gave of her penurie, should now bee
      seene in such an action, the wise men of this world
      would be so farre from commending her devotion,
      that they would laugh her to fcorne: Yet her zeale
      was so great that she could not stay ber hand, but
      must needes put in somewhat, even all that shee
      had: to what use? To the common treasurie.
      If I, (not worthy to bring any thing to the Church) may picke up the
      Crummes which have fallen from the bourde of the moft excellent writers of
      our owne Nation, may be well thought of by the godly, for my widow-like
      paines: I care not if I bee laughed to skorne of the wicked, private minded
      worldlings.
      Ihane in my vocation laboured to do somwhat: My purpose is to shew (in
      such sort as l can) what we have in Print, in our owne tongue, a thinge not
      regarded but of a few: For some soare so hie that they looke not so low, as on
      their owne countrie writers, and some regard not old Bookes, but aske what
      newes? Or new writers? Whereas I do thinke that since the Apostles time,
      ther hath not been more excellent Martyrs &amp; Confessors, than those that
      have written in the times of King Henrie the eight, King Edward, Queene
      Marie, and especialy in the godly and peaceable gouernment of our blessed
      Queene Elizabeth, and thofe of our owne Countrimen: which worthy men
      as divers of them are dead, so many of their excellent workes lie unknowen
      to most men.
      The confideration whereof hath moued me (most unworthie and unable of
      many others) to undertake this trifeling, yet moft toylesome &amp; troublesome
      busines, wherby the reader shall have this help that he may see at home in his
      studie what Books are written, and how many translated: And though it be
      unperfect, as I know not what first Booke either of Dictionarie, or Her-
      ball</print>
    </page>
      
    <page n="6">
      <print>ball, or such like was perfect at the first or second edition yet he that helpeth
      me to put in one Booke that I have not seene, I hope l shall shew him ten that
      he neuer heard of, either new or old, and as in many other faults by me come-
      mitted, so in this I pray you pardon me, in that I have not given the Titles of
      learning and birth due unto the Reverend men of other nations nor of our
      owne: I have purposely forborne to meddle with it, knowing it to bee above
      my Latchet: But these that have set down their degrees, I hake not willing-
      ly omitted. The auncient Popish Bookes that have beene Printed heere, I
      have also inserted among the rest, but the Bookes written by the fugitive
      Papistes, as also those that are written against the present genernment, I
      doe not thinke meete for me to meddle witball.

      Eeing dayly the great increase in all kind of Learning
      in this flourishing Realme of England, by the bles-

      only of Diuinitie, but of other excellent Arts, after the
      first impression, so spent &amp; gone, that they lie euen as
      it were buried in som few studies: That men desirous
      of such kind of Bookes, cannot aske for that they never heard of, and the Booke-
      seller cannot shew that he hath not: I haue thought good in my poor estate to vn-
      dertake this most tire-some businesse, hoping the Lord will send a blessing uppon
      my labours taken in my vocation; Thinking it as necessarie for the Booke-seller
      (conidering the number and nature of them) so have a Catalogue of our Eng-
      lish Bookes: As the Apothecarie his Dispersatorium, or the Schoole-master his
      Dictionarie.
      By meanes of which my poore trauailes, I shall draw to your memories Books
      that you could not remember: And shew to the learned such Bookes as they
      would not thinke were in our owne tongue: Which I have nor sleighted up the
      next way, but have to my great paines drawn the writers of any special argument
      together, nor following the order of the learned men that have written Latine
      Catalogues, Gesner, Simler, and our countriman John Bale. They make their Al-
      phabet by the Chriften name, I by the Sir name: They mingle Diuinitie, Law
      Phisicke, &amp;c. together, I set Diuinitie by it selfe. They set downe Printed and not
      Printed, I onely Printed, and none but such as I haue seene, hauing besides (be
      cause I would not bee iniurious to any man) left blancke roome heere and there
      throughout my booke, that what I haue left out may easily bee inserted, or what
      new Booke commeth may be placed in due order. Concerning the Books which
      are without Authors names called Anonymi, I have placed them either upon the
      Titles they bee entituled by, or else upon the matter they entreate of, and some-
      times upon both, for the easier finding of them.
      Concerning the bookes that bee tranflated, I haue obserued, (if the translator
      doe set his name) the Author, the Matter, the Translator, the Printer, or, (for
      whome</print>

      The Authors Sir name which is Daneus.
      The matter of the Booke which is Antichrist.
      The translators Sir name which is Swan,

      Arthur Golding. Printed for Lucas Harison and George Bishop. 1571. in 4
      The Aurhoris Calvin,
      The Matter, a Com-

      this our Nation is come vnto, by the blessing of God,
      and peaceable gouernment continued upon this fa-
      mous realme of England, aboue all the Nations of the
      world: and seeing still many excellent Bookes writ-
      ten, and Printed in our owne tongue; and that many
      of them after twenty or fortie yeares Printing, are so dispersed out of
      Booke-fellers hands, that they are not onely scarce to be found, but almost
      quite forgotten; I haue thought it worth my poore labour, to take some-
      paynes heerein, (though that the more learned sort would not willingly
      imploy their labour in the same,) to gather a Cathologue in such sort as I
      can, of the Bookes Printed in our owne tongue; which I doe hope will be
      delightsome to all English men that be learned, or desirous of learning:
      for hereby they may know euen in their studies, what Bookes are eyther
      by our own Countrymen written, or translated out of any other language,
      that those which defire to set foorth more Bookes for the benefit of their
      Contrey, may see what is already extant upon any argument.
      And as I have shewed, that in Diuine matters necessarie to saluation,
      no Nation hath better or more plentifull instructions in their owne tongue

      Most humbly beseeching your Honour, seeing the Lord hath made
      you a moft honourable Patrone of learned men and theyr works, you
      will vouchsafe also fauorablie to receive even the titles of theyr learned
      works, though gathered by one vnworthie to carrie their Bookes; yet if I

      To the right Worshipfull, the Professors of the Sciences
      Mathematicall, and to the learned Professors of
      Phisicke, and Surgery.
      T may be thought (right Worshipfull) a needlesse
      labour to make a Catalogue of English printed Books: yet
      to men of iudgment I hope it will be thought necessarie, for
      if learned men studie and spend their bedies and goods to
      further the knowledge of their Countrymen, for the good
      of the common weale, me thinketh it were pittie their stu-
      dies, and the benefit of them should lie hidden; in regard
      whereof, and that honest mindes desirous of knowledge,
      may see what helpes they may have to the studies they are addicted vnto, I have ga-
      thered this Mathematicke, Phisicke, and Chirurgicall table. Praying the learned in any,
      and euery of the sayd sciences, to pardon me, if I have not given them their iust Ti-
      tles, it is a thing which I cannot reach vnto, I doe commonly set them downe as I
      finde them, printed upon their owne books.
      And hoping that these my poore trauailes, will be a furtherance to the igno-
      rant desirous of knowledge, and a delight to the learned, shewing them (so well as
      I can,) what is alreadie in print upon any the arguments aboue speacified, they may
      the better proceed to write for the good of their most honorable Countrey of Eng-
      land, and their owne credite: beseeching God (the giuer of all good knowledge)
      to blesse their studies, I ceasse.

      To the Worshipfull, the Maister Wardens, and Assi-
      stants of the Company of the Stationers; and to all other Printers
      and Booke-fellers in generall.
      Auing shewed you in my former part, of the vse of my Ta-
      ble, I will onely in thys shew you and the curteous readers, that I
      have set the VVriters of Arithmetick, Musick, Nauigation and
      VVarre together, vsing the playnest way I could deuise, keepine
      the Alphabet by the sir name, and upon the matter it concerneth,
      as at the first sight it will plainely appeare.
      Now it resteth, that I should proceede to the thirde and last
      part, which is of Humanity, wherin I shall have occasion to shew,
      what wee have in our owne tongue, of Gramer, Logick, Rethoricke, Lawe, Historie,
      Poetrie, Policie, &amp;c. VWhich will for the most part concerne matters of Delight and Plea-
      sure, wherein I have already laboured, as in the rest, but finding it so troublesome to get sight
      of Books, and so tedious to digest into any good methode, I have thought good first to publish
      the two more necessarie parts, which if I may perceaue to be well liked of, will whet me on to
      proceed in the rest (as God shall make me able) with the better courage.
      VVhich busines, is not to be performed, as the Inuention of any booke, nor as a translation
      which a man hath before him; but it will aske long time to finde, and many places to search,
      ere a man shall come to any thing that may satisfie him; that he may thinke he commeth neer
      the number of good books that have beene published.
